These are some simple scripts I have created for WiFi pen testing. In my experience, 
using a Pi can be a little troublesome at times because you might not be at your normal desktop 
with all of your creature comforts. These scripts will reduce some of the time needed to perform
some of the tasks required.

*** a couple of notes/disclaimers/known issues ***
I am aware of the uni code issue and I am actively working on a solution
John wont be very affective on a pi, might be best to migrate those hashes to a more powerful system

MOST IMPORTANTLY
These scripts are purely for educational use only and should not be used on a system or network you
dont own or have authorization to break. Ok, now that the legal stuff is out of the way, have fun!
